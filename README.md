## Rules of the Game

You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

Simply follow the instructions below to play the game in case you are not familiar with the rules already

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are 'X' while your friend is 'O' (in the context of this game). Players take turns putting their tokens in empty squares.
- The instruction in this game is to choose a valid integer between 1 and 9 to select one of the 9 positions on the board.
- The first player to get 3 of the tokens in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
